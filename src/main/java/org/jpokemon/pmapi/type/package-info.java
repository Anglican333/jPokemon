/**
 * Provides classes that define the `types` available for Pok√©mon moves and

 * Types that this API understands must extend the abstract {@link PokemonType}

 * 
 * {@link ClassicTypes} provides a lookup for the 17 classic types and an empty
 * type, with some additional functionality. Unless you plan on writing your 
 * own types, this class should be sufficient.
