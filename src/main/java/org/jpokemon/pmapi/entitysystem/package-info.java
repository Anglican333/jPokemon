/**
 * Provides a simple entity-component framework (also called an entity 
 * system). Originally, it was designed for use with entities on an 
 * overworld map, such as you might encounter with signs/doors/NPCs in any 
 * Pok√©mon game. The format is inspired by [this post][link1].
 *
 * See [the entry in RougeBasin][link2] for more details. An simple setup might 
 * look like the one pictured below, which you can click for the source.
