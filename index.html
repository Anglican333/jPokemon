            <div class="section"><div class="section"><h3>jPok&#xe9;mon: The Pok&#xe9;mon API<a name="jPokmon:_The_Pokmon_API"></a></h3><p>This API (and in part, library) is a response to all of the disparate fan projects (games, engines, and resources) being written in Java. Very few of these projects pool their code, even if they are open source. My suspicion is that a readily accessible and more importantly <i>well-documented</i> API might alleviate some of the really dull data-type writing that everyone has to do, and help games get on their feet faster overall. To this end, this project contains (or will ideally contain)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data-types for abstract objects common to most (if not all) Pok&#xe9;mon projects: moves, items, species, natures, and so on.</li>
  <li>Serialization to and from formats such as <tt>.xml</tt>, <tt>.json</tt>, and sql databases for these objects.</li>
  <li>Managers and factories for these objects.</li>
  <li>Enums and lookup classes for things like types, experience curves, etc.</li>
</ul><p>This project is <i>not</i> a fully-featured engine or game library. There are no game loops. There are no graphics. In fact, there is no data whatsoever. If youre looking for a <tt>Pikachu.java</tt> file, you have come to the wrong place. If, on the other hand, you do not want to write the few hundred lines of setters and getters you will probably need for your <tt>PokemonSpecies.java</tt> file, this project is for you. Two more important aspects of this API are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To facilitate <i>all</i> kinds of projects, it is designed to be highly extensible. Making new Pok&#xe9;mon, Items, and Moves is (hopefully) fairly easy.</li>
  <li>This API is built (hah!) on the assumption that most actual data will be serialized from some kind of database, <tt>.xml</tt>, or <tt>.json</tt> file. This has two implications: first, every object has full getters and setters and an empty constructor, and second, objects generally only store the <i>names</i> of other objects, as opposed to instances themselves. This means that <tt>managers</tt> in some form or another will probably be required to handle your data.</li>
</ul><p>For more information on how to make use of the API, see the (very sparse at the moment) <a href="usage.html">Getting Started</a> page. For a much better understanding, you can browse the source code or read the <a href="apidocs/index.html">javadocs</a>. In the future, this site will hopefully have some tutorials attached to it.</p>
